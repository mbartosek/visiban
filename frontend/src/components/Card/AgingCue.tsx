/**
 * Non-color stage cue for an aging-tinted card (#1843, #1863, WCAG 1.4.1).
 *
 * The `Stale · Nd` badge only renders on non-compact cards at comfortable or
 * standard density, and only when no higher-priority urgency (overdue,
 * due-soon) preempts it. Everywhere else — every compact card, dense cards,
 * preempted badges — the aging tint was the only at-a-glance signal, so the
 * stages differed by hue alone. The yellow `warning` stage never gets the
 * badge at all, so before #1863 it was told apart from a fresh card by hue and
 * opacity only. CardItem renders this glyph exactly when the card has an aging
 * tint and the badge is not visible.
 *
 * Shape, not text: a compact card is ~77px of content wide (two-column grid
 * in a 220px cell), so `41d` would eat half the title. Three ascending bars
 * with the solid count equal to the stage multiple (1×, 2×, 3×) tell the
 * stages apart by shape; the bars above the stage are ghosted. The warning
 * stage has no solid bar: its shortest bar is drawn hollow (outline only), so
 * it reads as "not yet one bar" — a hint, not an alarm. The hollow outline is
 * at full opacity because it is the only stage-bearing mark; an all-ghost
 * meter would fall below the 3:1 a non-text graphic needs. The day count
 * lives in the accessible name and in the card's own aging tooltip.
 *
 * It sits inline at the start of the title `<p>` so it shares the title's
 * line box and never changes card height. Do not wrap it in `inline-flex`:
 * that moves the line's baseline onto the SVG and shifts the title.
 *
 * The aria-label states age and multiple, never "Stale": the stage is
 * client-computed and the server's `is_stale` can disagree by a day at the
 * edge (see formatAgingTooltip). No `title` attribute — the card's tooltip
 * already opens on hover and keyboard focus with the same information.
 * Because it leads the title, the card button's content-derived name starts
 * with "Idle N days, …" — accepted: the leading position is a hard visual
 * constraint (the bulk-select checkbox covers the trailing edge).
