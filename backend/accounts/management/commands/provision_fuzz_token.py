"""Provision a Personal Access Token for the backend-schema-fuzz CI job.

Mints a scoped (read+write, non-admin) PAT for an existing, non-superuser
board member so schemathesis (#1080) exercises the permission-shaped
responses a normal member actually gets, rather than a superuser's
unrestricted view of every endpoint. The issue is explicit that the fuzzer
must authenticate as "a normal board member — not a superuser".

Requires the target user to already exist — run `seed_demo_data` first. The
demo board's non-owner members (`demo2`..`demo5`) are plain `MEMBER`s with no
`is_superuser`/`is_site_admin`/`can_access_all_content` flag, which is why the
CI job defaults to `demo2`.

The raw token is written to a file (mode 0600), never to stdout or a log
statement, matching the pattern `ensure_site_admin` uses for the initial
admin password — CI reads the file into a job variable rather than the
command's output ever appearing in a pipeline log.

For throwaway CI databases only. ``--set-random-password`` (off by default)
gives a password-less target a random password that is never recorded (#1607).
The seeded members are social-only, and both password-change routes
(``/auth/password/change/``, ``/auth/change-password/``) skip the
current-password check for such an account so it can set its first password. A
fuzzer that generates two matching, valid new passwords therefore changes the
password, which revokes every PAT, and every later request in the run answers
401. With a password nobody holds, those routes require a current password the
fuzzer cannot supply. The flag is opt-in because on a real social-only or
SSO-only account a usable password also lifts the verified-email gate on
password reset (``accounts/forms.py``), so whoever controls the stored mailbox
could set a password and sign in.

The flag uses a bare ``set_password`` rather than
``credentials.finalize_password_change`` on purpose. The CI database is fresh,
and the token is minted after the password change under the same user-row
lock, so there is nothing to revoke and the new token is not revoked either.
That exemption holds only for a throwaway database. Any other password change
must go through ``finalize_password_change``.
