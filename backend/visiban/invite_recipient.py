"""Emailed invites are bound to the address they were sent to (#1678).

A board invite (``vbnb_``) or group invite (``vbng_``) minted by a send-invite
endpoint stores ``recipient_hash``: a keyed hash of the address it was emailed
to. Redemption, on every path (the join endpoints, REST registration and
OAuth signup), compares that hash with the redeeming account's addresses and
refuses the invite when none match. A shareable link (``delivery=link``) has no
recipient and stores NULL, so it keeps its "link, not email" behavior: anyone
holding it may use it.

What is stored
--------------
``HMAC-SHA256(key derived from SECRET_KEY, normalized address)`` via Django's
``salted_hmac`` with a dedicated salt, as 64 hex characters. A plain digest of
an address could be reversed by hashing candidate addresses; a keyed one cannot
without the server key. The plaintext address is never stored or logged.

Normalization is ``strip().lower()`` — the same rule the site-invite dedup
uses (``accounts.invite_utils._normalize_email_for_dedup``), so an address
typed with different capitalization still matches. Provider-specific folding
(dots, ``+tags``) is deliberately not applied: they are different mailboxes.

Which of the redeemer's addresses count
---------------------------------------
- An existing account joining (``at_registration=False``): its **verified**
  allauth ``EmailAddress`` rows. Under ``EMAIL_VERIFICATION=optional`` or
  ``none`` the account's ``User.email`` counts as well, because those modes do
  not ask anyone to prove an address, and an admin-created account may have no
  ``EmailAddress`` row at all. Under ``mandatory``, only verified rows count;
  an unconfirmed pending address change never does.
- A new account at registration (``at_registration=True``): the signup
  address (``User.email``) and any verified row the signup created (an OAuth
  provider may report a verified address). This decides whether the sign-up
  may use the invite at all.

When a group or board membership is granted (#1704)
---------------------------------------------------
Under ``mandatory``, a group or board invite whose invited address is not yet
verified on the new account does not grant its membership at registration.
The invite is reserved for that account (``reserved_for``) and is neither
consumed nor granted; the membership is granted, and the invite consumed, when
the account confirms the invited address (``grant_reserved_invites``, an
allauth ``email_confirmed`` receiver). A sign-up whose provider already
reports the invited address as verified is granted at registration, as are
all sign-ups under ``optional`` / ``none`` and unbound invites. A site invite
admits the account itself and grants no membership; under ``mandatory`` that
account cannot sign in until it confirms its address, so site invites are
still consumed at registration.

So the binding is as strong as the site's email verification setting: under
``mandatory`` it means "whoever controls the invited mailbox"; under
``optional`` / ``none`` it means "an account that claims the invited address".

Invites minted before #1678 have ``recipient_hash`` NULL and redeem exactly as
they did before, so upgrading breaks no invite already in someone's inbox.

Comparison also tries every key in Django's ``SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS``. Visiban
does not expose that setting through an environment variable, so it only
applies when an operator sets it in a settings override; by default, changing
``DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`` makes pending emailed invites stop matching.
