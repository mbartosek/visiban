"""A column, swimlane or board delete racing a card child write (#1599).

The mirror of #1587's ``delete_card`` fix. Deleting a container cascades to
its cards, and Django's collector reads the cards' child rows (comments,
checklist items, attachments, relations, activity) before it deletes them. A
child write holding ``lock_card_for_write`` could insert a row the collector
had not seen and commit before the container's card ``DELETE`` ran; the card
foreign keys are ``DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED`` on PostgreSQL, so the
container delete then failed its own FK check at COMMIT with an
``IntegrityError`` — a 500 on ``DELETE`` of the column, swimlane or board.

The fix is ``boards.services.cards.lock_cards_for_cascade``: each container
delete locks every card it is about to cascade to, ``FOR UPDATE`` in one
pk-ordered statement, before the collector runs. A write that started first
then commits before the collector reads, so its new rows are cascaded away
too; a write that starts after waits, finds the card gone, and answers 404.

PostgreSQL only: the race needs real concurrent transactions (the
hold-the-transaction pattern from ``docs/development/testing.md``). To see
the bug, make ``lock_cards_for_cascade`` a no-op: every ``*_then_delete`` test
fails with an ``IntegrityError`` raised from the container delete.
