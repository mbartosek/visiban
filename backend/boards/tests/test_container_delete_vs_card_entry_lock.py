"""A column, swimlane or board delete racing a card *entering* it (#1602).

The follow-up to #1599 (``test_container_delete_vs_card_write_lock``).
``lock_cards_for_cascade`` locks the cards a container delete cascades to, but
only the ones that exist when it runs. A card ``create_card`` inserted into the
container, or one ``move_card`` moved into an empty cell of it (so there was no
container card to wait on), could commit after that statement and before the
collector's card ``DELETE``. The card's foreign keys are ``DEFERRABLE
INITIALLY DEFERRED`` on PostgreSQL, so the container delete then failed its FK
check at COMMIT with an ``IntegrityError`` — a 500 on ``DELETE``. The other
order was a 500 too: a create that queued behind the delete's column row found
it gone (``Column.DoesNotExist``), and a create or move into a deleted
swimlane failed its own deferred FK check.

The fix: the helper also takes ``entry_columns``, the column rows every
service path that puts a card into the container holds until it commits, and
locks them after the cards (card -> column, the documented order), then
re-reads the container's cards and retries under a savepoint if one arrived
that it did not lock. ``create_card`` and ``move_card`` re-check their target
column and swimlane once they hold the column row, answering 404 for a
container deleted while they waited.

Two orders per (container x entry path), over REST and the Django admin:

* ``entry_then_delete`` — the entry holds its column row with the new card
  uncommitted; the delete queues on the column, retries, and cascades the
  newcomer away (204), and the entry itself succeeds.
* ``delete_then_entry`` — the delete holds its locks; the entry queues on the
  column row, finds its target gone, and answers 404 with nothing written.

PostgreSQL only, except ``ContainerChangedTests``, which forces the retry to
exhaust and runs on SQLite too. To see the bug, call the helper without
``entry_columns`` in the views and admins: every ``entry_then_delete`` test
fails with a 500 or an ``IntegrityError`` and every ``delete_then_entry`` test
fails its "did not wait" assertion.
