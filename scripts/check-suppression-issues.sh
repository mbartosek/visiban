# scripts/check-suppression-issues.sh — SUPPRESSED-UNTIL(#NNNN) marker gate.
#
# Problem (#1092): a suppression (`pytest.mark.skip`, `eslint-disable`, a
# coverage `omit`, an excluded a11y rule) is added for a reason that is true
# *today*. Nothing ever revisits it, so the suppression outlives its reason
# silently and the gate it disables stays green while hiding real failures.
#
# Convention: a suppression that is waiting on tracked work (as opposed to
# being permanently intentional) carries a marker naming the issue that would
# remove it:
#
#   @pytest.mark.skip(reason="SUPPRESSED-UNTIL(#1084): arm64 images unavailable")
#   // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps -- SUPPRESSED-UNTIL(#1057): deps churn until the token migration lands
#
# This script greps the tree for `SUPPRESSED-UNTIL(#N)`, looks up each cited
# issue's state via the GitLab REST API, and fails — naming file, line, and
# issue — if any cited issue is already CLOSED. A suppression with a plain
# `-- reason` and no marker is never touched; this convention is for
# *temporary* suppressions only (see docs/development/suppressions.md).
#
# Documented convention: docs/development/suppressions.md, CLAUDE.md.
#
# Why this must run on `main` and on schedule, not only on MRs: the
# triggering event is "an issue closed", not "a commit landed" — an MR-only
# job would never fire once the suppression's branch has already merged.
#
# #1694: the previous version sent `JOB-TOKEN: $CI_JOB_TOKEN` to
# `GET /projects/:id/issues/:iid` — which answers 401 to ANY job token on
# this public project, while the identical request with no auth header at
# all answers 200. `curl -sf` swallowed that 401 into an empty body, every
# lookup read "unknown", and the gate's own documented fail-open policy for
# an unreachable tracker silently absorbed what should have been a hard
# "closed" finding: this gate had never actually blocked a closed-issue
# citation in CI, because `frontend/src`/`backend` held zero markers to
# notice it with. It also made one request per marker site with no retry
# (429 risk against GitLab's per-IP anonymous budget) and used `sed | head`
# behind a pipe. Fixed by porting scripts/lib/gitlab-issues.sh
# (trueppm/trueppm#4452): resolve every *unique* cited issue in one batched
# call, retrying transient failures, with GITLAB_API_TOKEN / ISSUES_API_TOKEN
# only — never JOB-TOKEN. The job now runs this script with `bash` (was
# `sh`) to use that library; see docs/development/suppressions.md.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check-suppression-issues.sh              # real run
#   bash scripts/check-suppression-issues.sh --self-test   # gate self-test
#
# Self-test (issue #1093's meta-gate requires every bespoke CI gate to carry
# one): builds a small fixture tree, points the issue-state lookup at a mock
# (no network), and asserts the detection logic actually fires on a marker
# citing a "closed" issue, passes one citing an "open" issue, and leaves a
# plain `-- reason` suppression alone. Exits non-zero if any of that does not
# hold — i.e. if the gate itself is broken. The real-fetch path (batching,
# the JOB-TOKEN-never-sent guarantee, and the new "tracker didn't return
# this issue" state) is covered separately, with a fake `curl` on PATH, by
# scripts/tests/check-suppression-issues.test.sh and
# scripts/tests/gitlab-issues.test.sh — this inline self-test only exercises
# CHECK_SUPPRESSION_MOCK_CLOSED, which never touches the network.
