#
# Unit test for scripts/check-suppression-issues.sh — the SUPPRESSED-UNTIL(#N)
# marker gate (#1092). The gate's whole job is to fail when a suppression
# cites an issue that has since closed; a regression here would let it go
# quietly green forever, exactly the failure mode the gate exists to prevent
# (see #1090, where 0% coverage on git_lens went unnoticed for months).
#
# This test drives the script's own CHECK_SUPPRESSION_MOCK_CLOSED test hook
# (the same one --self-test uses) against small fixture trees, so it needs no
# network access and depends on no real GitLab issue existing or closing.
#
# #1694 added a second kind of case below (see "REAL FETCH PATH"): the mock
# hook never exercised check-suppression-issues.sh's actual GitLab API call,
# which is exactly how the JOB-TOKEN-401 defect went unnoticed — those cases
# drive gitlab_issue_states through a fake `curl` placed first on PATH
# instead, with no mock hook involved, proving the real request shape:
# unique-iid batching, a closed issue still blocking, an open issue still
# passing, and JOB-TOKEN never sent even when CI_JOB_TOKEN is set.

# The gate always scans SCAN_PATHS ("frontend/src backend"), not an arbitrary
# directory, so to test it against small fixture trees instead of the whole
# real repo we source its function definitions (run_scan, resolve_issue_state)
# and call run_scan directly. The gate is bash; the only wrinkle is its
# trailing `main "$@"` line, which would run on source too and scan the real
# repo as a side effect — so we source a scratch copy with that last line
# stripped instead of the gate file itself.
#
# The sourced file also defines and immediately runs its own top-level
# `REPO_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"; cd "$REPO_ROOT"`
# (outside any function) AND, since #1694, a `source
# "${REPO_ROOT}/scripts/lib/gitlab-issues.sh"` that depends on that
# REPO_ROOT being right — unlike `$0`, `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` DOES follow a
# sourced file, so sourcing a bare copy dropped directly into $TMP computes
# a REPO_ROOT that is wrong *and consequential*: the inner `source` fails
# immediately, before we would ever get a chance to restore anything. Fixed
# by mirroring the real scripts/ layout under $TMP (copy the library to the
# same relative path) so that inner source resolves correctly either way,
# then overwriting our own $REPO_ROOT/cwd back to the real repo root
# afterward regardless.
